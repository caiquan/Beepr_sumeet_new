/**
 The CatalyzeHTTPManager class provides an abstracted layer of functionality in 
 order to not clutter to core of the catalyze.io iOS SDK. Network calls were viewed 
 as a separate entity of the SDK entirely.  In order to emphasize this, **ALL** 
 network traffic in or out of the SDK goes through one of the following four 
 methods.  The library used for network traffic is AFNetworking found here 
 http://afnetworking.com/ . 
 
 The main purpose for this class is to translate AFNetworking results into
 completion blocks specified in CatalyzeConstants.
 
 This class does not have any ties to the rest of the catalyze.io iOS SDK and so 
 it can be used as its own entity for your personal networking use.  Or you 
 can simply download AFNetworking directly at the above link.
